# SON Algorithm Implementation with Spark

## Overview
This assignment focuses on implementing the SON Algorithm using the Spark Framework to identify frequent itemsets within large datasets. 

## Datasets
There are one simulated dataset and one real-world dataset, starting with task1 on the simulated CSV file provided, then moving to task2 with the Ta Feng dataset to simulate similar data structures.

## Task 1: Simulated Data
Analyze two CSV files (small1.csv and small2.csv) for frequent itemsets, focusing on businesses and users as singletons, pairs, triples, etc., based on a given support threshold.

## Task 2: Ta Feng Data
Utilize the Ta Feng dataset to explore frequent itemsets, focusing on product IDs associated with customer IDs, aggregating daily purchases into single transactions.
